| Published in? When (if mentioned) ?               | Not mentioned                                                       |
| General topic?               | Transmission of antiobiotic resistance between bacteria                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? | In 2012, a patient contracted a MRSA (methicillin resistant *Staphilococcus aureus*). First, treatment worked but few months later, MRSA became resistant to treatment. Scientists discovered it was acquiring resistant as a gift of chuck of DNA from another becterium.  They discovered that *Enterococcus faecaelis* (a good bacterium of guts, well resistant to antibiotic) had a system of protection against unwanter DNA (used by scientists to edit DNA) because those bacteria can transfer a part of DNA to other bacteria to make them resistant to antibiotic. Here, it was the case with vicomycine for MRSA. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | *Enterococcus faecalis* can change its DNA to become resistant against antibiotic and its can transfer a part of DNA to other bacteria to confer the same resistance (as for methicillin resistant *Staphilococcus aureus*) |
| Remaining questions?         | Scientists don't understand completly how *Enterococcus faecalis* changes his DNA and which portion of DNA is critical for this bacterium |
