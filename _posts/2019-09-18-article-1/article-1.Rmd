| General topic?               |  Natural antioxidant helping eliminate antiobiotic resistant bacteria                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? | -	Epigallocatechin (EGCG) can restore activity of aztreonam (common antiobiotic)                 -	In vitro test to analyse interaction with bacteria and EGCG and aztreonam in combinaison or individually -	Minimal to no toxicity in human skin cells and Galleria mellonella larvae |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  -	EGCG increase uptake of aztreonam by increasing permeability in bacteria -	Combinaison of aztreonam and EGCG significantly more effective at reducing numbers of bacteria |
| Remaining questions?         | -	Natural products in combinaison with currently antibiotic may be a way of improving effectiveness  -	Potential mechanism : EGCG’s interference with biochemical pathway linked to antiobiotic susceptibility |
